The way to start a benchmark job:

First you need to have the antidote image and env file in each site you want to run the experiment
~/antidote_images/antidote_image_init.tgz
~/antidote_images/mywheezy-x64-base.env
Ask me for images if you need them

To get a reservation for example run, this gives an 30 min reservation with 1 site at rennes and one at lille:
oargridsub -t deploy -w '0:30:00' rennes:rdef="/nodes=1",lille:rdef="/nodes=1"

oargridsub -t deploy -w '6:00:00' -s '2015-07-26 20:00:00' sophia:rdef="/nodes=22":prop="cluster='suno'",lille:rdef="/nodes=22":prop="cluster='chinqchint'"

Then run this from the frontend to deploy the nodes:

~/basho_scripts/grid5000start.sh

Then can ssh to the node that will be running basho bench.  On this node need to update the script/allnodes file with the names of the other nodes.
(Should create a script to do this automatically).
Then can run the benchmark as normal.






Some other notes:


This doesnt work, don't have the rights to run kdeploy directly from the deploy job:

oargridsub -t deploy -w '0:30:00' rennes:rdef="/nodes=1",lille:rdef="/nodes=1" -p ~/basho_scripts/grid5000start.sh



A grid job that you can ssh to:

oargridsub -t deploy -w '0:30:00' rennes:rdef="/nodes=1",lille:rdef="/nodes=1"
