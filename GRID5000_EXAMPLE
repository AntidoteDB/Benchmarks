The way to start a benchmark job:

oargridsub -t deploy -w '0:30:00' rennes:rdef="/nodes=1",lille:rdef="/nodes=1"

Then run this from the frontend to deploy the nodes:

~/basho_scripts/grid5000start.sh

Then can ssh to the node that will be running basho bench.  On this node need to update the script/allnodes file with the names of the other nodes.
(Should create a script to do this automatically).
Then can run the benchmark as normal.






Some other notes:


This doesnt work, don't have the rights to run kdeploy directly from the deploy job:

oargridsub -t deploy -w '0:30:00' rennes:rdef="/nodes=1",lille:rdef="/nodes=1" -p ~/basho_scripts/grid5000start.sh



A grid job that you can ssh to:

oargridsub -t deploy -w '0:30:00' rennes:rdef="/nodes=1",lille:rdef="/nodes=1"
